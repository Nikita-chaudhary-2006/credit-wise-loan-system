### Supervised Machine Learning Minor Project

CreditWise Loan System is a supervised machine learning project that predicts whether a loan should be approved or rejected using applicant financial and personal data. It helps automate loan decisions, reduce risk, and improve accuracy.

##  Project Overview
Financial institutions receive many loan applications daily. Manual verification is slow, inconsistent, and error-prone.  
This project uses **supervised machine learning** to automatically predict loan approval outcomes based on applicant data.
